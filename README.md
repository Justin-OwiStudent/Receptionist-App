### Project Description

This SPA project was created in React.js alongside with data from PHP database, this is a medical receptionist application where you can control the amount of patients, doctors and appointments you have.

### Built With

* [React](https://reactjs.org/)
* [PHP](https://www.php.net/)

<!-- CONCEPT PROCESS -->
<!-- Briefly explain your concept ideation process -->
<!-- here you will add things like wireframing, data structure planning, anything that shows your process. You need to include images-->
## Concept Process

The `Conceptual Process` is the set of actions, activities and research that was done when starting this project.

initially i had a poor Ui design for this project and soon restarted the project, i did a very simple UI design with the functionality easily incorporated.


<!-- DEVELOPMENT PROCESS -->
## Development Process

The `Development Process` is the technical implementations and functionality done in the frontend and backend of the application.

I made use of PHP, it was a big learning curve but in the end its a very nice workflow to use PHP in my project, i discovered more details and bells and whistles that react holds and i am excited to explore these factors in the future.

### Implementation Process
<!-- stipulate all of the functionality you included in the project -->
<!-- This is your time to shine, explain the technical nuances of your project, how did you achieve the final outcome!-->

* React.JS project started and UI made.
* Implemented Routing with `React-Router v6`.
* PHP was implemented
* initially i had loads of errors with PHP, i finally got the understanding of how the errors work and could from there easily fix the problem.
* Even now i still have problems with the Update and Delete functionality, i traced the code and backtracked all the way but i could not find the fault unfortunatly

#### Highlights
<!-- stipulated the highlight you experienced with the project -->
* I got a greater understanding of how powerful react can be and what it is capable of.
* I got introduced to PHP and what it is capable of and hwo it works with React.js to connect and update to the database.
* Personally i got alot better at problem solving my code, PHP is very precise and requires your code to be perfect


#### Challenges
<!-- stipulated the challenges you faced with the project and why you think you faced it or how you think you'll solve it (if not solved) -->
* i at first had a ton of errors with PHP and could not connect with the DB for the first few weeks, soon to realise my inputs didnt match, just to show how PHP requires your code not to have any faults.
* I had a major challenge trying to understand how the snakes and ladders of props works within React.js with PHP, it gets very confusing so you have to keep your eye on the ball.


#### Above And Beyond

What aspects of this final build contribute to the `Above And Beyond` Component of your brief?
<!-- what did you learn outside of the classroom and implement into your project-->
* Deep delve into component based development.
* For me i had a tough time to learn react initially, but this term i decided to go head first and untangle everything, instead of reusing certain components instead i went to make new and to remap those components to work with the different sections of my code, i got a much greater understanding of React.js and for me that is a big milestone that i am proud of. i also started to snap how Javascript work, as simple as it sounds its one of my biggest challenges and im starting to overcome it, i call that development.

### Future Implementation
<!-- stipulate functionality and improvements that can be implemented in the future. -->

* For the future i would defnetly want my functionality to be flawless, updating and deleting of all sorts should work in the future aswell as getting more validation going

<!-- MOCKUPS -->
